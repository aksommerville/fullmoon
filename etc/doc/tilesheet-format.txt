Fullmoon Tilesheet Format

By "tilesheet" we mean the metadata associated with an image containing 256 tiles.
One byte per tile of metadata is stored for the game at runtime.
Three additional bytes are stored for the editor only.

Tilesheet sources should be named after their image eg:
  "mylovelysprites.png" => "mylovelysprites_props.txt"

At runtime, each tilesheet is (const uint8_t[256]), indexed by tileid, nice and simple.
Stored as text, basically a hex dump.
Like maps, one is not expected to work with the text format directly. Use the web editor.
But it should play nice with version control and all that.

Each line of the file is either empty or 32 hex digits.
No comments, no fences, etc.

First 16 lines are the tileprops. See FMN_TILE_* in src/game/fullmoon.h.
  01 SOLID
  02 HOLE

Second 16 lines are group IDs.
Each tile can be assigned to an arbitrary group for neighbor joining.
Group zero is a catch-all meaning "no group".

Third 16 lines are neighbor masks:
  80 NW
  40 N
  20 NE
  10 W
  08 E
  04 SW
  02 S
  01 SE
If set, this tile expects a neighbor from the same group in that position.

Fourth 16 lines are priority.
When selecting a tile randomly, all those of the same group and mask are candidates.
Their priority is the relative likelihood of choosing that tile.
A tile with priority zero can only be selected explicitly, but still participates in neighbor joining.
eg you might have a few grass tiles at priority 255, and then some flowers at like 30.

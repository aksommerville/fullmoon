Fullmoon Map Format

After compilation, maps are C objects, see struct fmn_map in src/game/fullmoon.h.
Those C files are produced from text files.
Text, so they play nice with version control, and there's a chance that one could troubleshoot them manually.
But realistically you should only edit via the web app.

Each map is a grid of tiles no longer than 255 on each axis, in multiples of the screen size (9x5).
You can go up to 28x51 screens in one map, surely larger than we'll ever need.

File begins with a header, line-oriented with '#' introducing a line comment.

--- HEADER ---

tilesheet=NAME
  REQUIRED. Must refer to an image and a tileprops.
  There must be a const struct fmn_image* with exactly this name, and a const uint8_t[256] named {NAME}_props
  
size=W H
  REQUIRED. Size of map, must be multiples of (9,5) in (9,5)..(252,255).
  
region=0..7|NAME
  REQUIRED. "region" is the map you would return to, if you die or save in this one.
  The 8 region trailheads are hard-coded.
  TODO region names. So far: "home" "cave" "cheatertrap"
  
poi=X Y Q0 Q1 Q2 Q3 QP
  Add a Point Of Interest generically.
  (X,Y) are tile coordinates.
  Q0 is the usage.
  (Q1,Q2,Q3,QP) depend on Q0.
  For doors, spawn points, etc.
  POI are allowed to exceed the map's width and height where possible. (but not the left or top edges)
  eg I expect to use that for exit doors from single-screen interiors.
  
poi Q0 (Q1,Q2,Q3,QP)
  0x00 Default start point. (none,none,none,none). Default (w,h)/2 if unset.
  0x01 Door. (dstx,dsty,none,map)
  0x02 Sprite. (arg,arg,arg,sprdef)
    All of a map's sprites exist at all times, even when offscreen.
  0x03 Treadle. (arg,arg,arg,function). Call a function when the hero enters or leaves.
    void function(uint8_t state/*0=leave,1=enter*/,uint8_t Q1,uint8_t Q2,uint8_t Q3);
  0x04 Visibility. (arg,arg,arg,function). Same as Treadle, but call when hero enters or leaves the screen containing this POI.
  0x05 Proximity. (arg,arg,arg,function). Call each frame with the hero's distance, if on-screen. And with 0xffff when exiting the screen.
    void function(uint16_t distancemm,uint8_t Q1,uint8_t Q2,uint8_t Q3);
  0x06 Edge Door. (offsetmsb,offsetlsb,none,map)
    Point must be one of the corners; the other map is a neighbor on the edge clockwise of that corner.
    (offset) is signed, where does the map line up relative to this one, in tiles.
    It is expected but not mandatory that the other map contain an Edge Door pointing back here.
    Hero can walk offscreen anywhere. We should arrange for there always to be an Door or Edge Door where that's possible.
  0x07 Interior Door. (dstx,dsty,none,none)
    Link to some point on the same map. Travelling through the door does not reload sprites or anything.
  
--- BODY ---

Header ends with a line containing exactly:
BEGIN_BODY

After that, comments and blank lines are no longer allowed.
Each line is a packed string of hexadecimal digits exactly (w*2) long, and a newline.
There must be exactly (h) lines.
